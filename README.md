# Practical Pedagogical Techniques - a mini-workshop
In this workshop, we will tackle pedagogical techniques that can help you improve your own training sessions. We will be teaching you, and you will be teaching each other about formative assessment and the use of inclusive language and engaging discourse. At the end of this training, you will know how to implement peer instruction, monitor student learning, use simple language and avoid jargon, and use analogies, personal stories and/or humour to make content stick.
